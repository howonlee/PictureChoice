You will see two images presented one after another.\nIn each image, there will be several colored squares scattered over the entire image.\nSometimes one of the squares will change in color from the 1st image to the 2nd image. Press the YES button if there is such a change, and press the NO button if there is no change. You will receive feedback on whether your judgement is correct or incorrect. Try to be as accurate as possible.\nAfter the feedback, the next trial will start immediately. There will be 100 such trials broken into two blocks. You can take a break after the first block.\n\nEnter your Amazon Turk id below.</string>
